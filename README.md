# Spring course by Evgenii Shagov
## Introduction
You may be thinking "not another framework." Why should you read this article, or download the Spring Framework (if you haven't already), when there are so many J2EE frameworks, or when you could build your own framework? The sustained high level of interest in the community is one indication that Spring must offer something valuable; there are also numerous technical reasons.

I believe that Spring is unique, for several reasons:

* **It addresses important areas that many other popular frameworks don't.** Spring focuses around providing a way to manage your business objects.
* **Spring is both comprehensive and modular.** Spring has a layered architecture, meaning that you can choose to use just about any part of it in isolation, yet its architecture is internally consistent. So you get maximum value from your learning curve. You might choose to use Spring only to simplify use of JDBC, for example, or you might choose to use Spring to manage all your business objects. And it's easy to introduce Spring incrementally into existing projects.
* **Spring is designed from the ground up to help you write code that's easy to test.** Spring is an ideal framework for test driven projects.
* **Spring is an increasingly important integration technology,** its role recognized by several large vendors.
Spring is not necessarily one more framework dependency for your project. Spring is potentially a one-stop shop, addressing most infrastructure concerns of typical applications. It also goes places other frameworks don't.

Since January 2003, Spring has been hosted on SourceForge. There are now 20 developers, with the leading contributors devoted full-time to Spring development and support. The flourishing open source community has helped it evolve into far more than could have been achieved by any individual.
